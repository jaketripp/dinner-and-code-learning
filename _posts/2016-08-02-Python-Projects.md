Dinner and Code currently offers two programming paths: Python and
javascript development. On this page are the Python projects.

<em>Python is a modern, interactive, object oriented programming language. Its clear
syntax and extensive libraries make it a great choice for beginners that
want to learn to write code without having to write absolutely everything
on their own.</em>

# Project 1: Dice Rolling Program
Difficulty Level: Beginner

Language: Python

## Concepts Learned:
* Using a text editor and console
* Importing a module
* Creating a WHILE loop
* Working with Integers
* Print

## Description:
This basic dice rolling program will let you get comfortable with coding in Python. The
program will randomly select a number (based on the number of “sides” your die
has) and print it out on the screen.

## What you’ll need:

### Text editor such as:

1. NotePad++ ([https://notepad-plus-plus.org](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/))

2. Brackets ([http://brackets.io/](http://brackets.io/))

3. TextWrangler ([http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/))

### The How-To Video for this Project
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/48n9NnK4k-M)

## The Steps

### Step 1: Get Set Up
You’ll need to install a text editor and configure it for your particular machine. Since
the steps vary, it’s best to do some Google Fu as it relates to your particular
text editor + OS combination.

See: [Learn Python the Hard Way Lesson](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html)

You’ll then need to install Python 2.7: [Python.org Download](http://python.org/download)

### Step 2: Create a file in your Text editor

Go ahead and create a .py file in your editor. This file is what you’ll call in your command
line. Make sure you save it in the right place so Python can call it up.

### Step 3: Start writing some code

This program has several components you must include:

* Call the Random Module
* Define a function to Roll the dice
* Define a main() function of the program
* We should be good to go on Monday with that outline and agendaPrint the results

### Code Example:

~~~ python
from builtins import input
import random

def roll(sides=6):
    num_rolled = random.randint(1, sides)
    return num_rolled

def main():
    sides = 6
    rolling = True
    while rolling:
        roll_again = input("Ready to roll? ENTER=Roll. Q=Quit. ")
        if roll_again.lower() != "q":
            num_rolled = roll(sides)

            print("You rolled a {}".format(num_rolled))
        else:
            rolling = False

    print("Thanks for playing.")

main()
~~~

### Step 4: Run the program

In your command line, go ahead and run the program. If you need help, see:

# Project 2:  Mad Libs Generator

Difficulty Level: Beginner

Language: Python (v3)

## Concepts Learned:
* Using a text editor and console
* Importing a module
* Creating a WHILE loop
* Working with Integers
* Print

## Description:
The mad libs generator will take a few inputs from the user and then
generate a funny story! Try it out and have some fun

## Learning Resources:
<em>See lesson 1's resources</em>

[How-To Video for this Project](https://youtu.be/Oq75BBqd2y0)

### Step 3: Start writing some code
This project is creative, so much of the code is up to you! The components required to make it work include:
* Print function
* Main function
* Variables
* Strings

#### Code Example:
See: http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/madlib2.html

~~~ python
# python 2: remove 'from builtins import input'

from builtins import input
print("Welcome to Mad Libs - Python Edition. Follow the prompts to create your own hilarious story.")

# python 2: use raw_input('') instead of input('')
	# proper_name1 = raw_input("Enter a name: ")

proper_name1 = input("Enter a name: ")
proper_name2 = input("Enter another name: ")
noun1 = input("Enter a proper title: ")
place1 = input("Enter a place: ")
place2 = input("Enter another place: ")
verb1 = input("Enter a present-tense verb: ")
noun3 = input("Enter a noun: ")
noun2 = input("Enter a plural noun: ")
noun4 = input("Enter another plural noun: ")
num2 = input("Enter a number: ")
num1 = input("Enter another number: ")
percent1 = input("Enter another number: ")

# \n inside of a string means new line

print("Dear {}, It is my pleasure to {} to you today. I am {} and I'm the "
     "{} of {}. I have inherited {} {} but I need your help to get it to {}. "
     "Please send me your {} and the sum of {} {} to get started, and I will "
      "give you {} percent of my inheritance. Yours truly, {}".format(
          proper_name1, verb1, proper_name2, noun1, place1, num1, noun2,
          place2, noun3, num2, noun4, percent1, proper_name2))
~~~

## Step 4: Run the program
In your command line, go ahead and run the program. If you need help, see: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex1.html

# Project 3: Hangman

Difficulty Level: Intermediate

Language: Python (v3)

## Concepts Learned:
* Using a text editor and console
* Importing a module
* Creating a WHILE loop
* Working with Integers
* Print
* Random
* Variables
* Boolean
* Input/Output
* Char
* Strings
* Length

## Description:

The main goal here is to create a “guess the word” game. The user needs to be able to input letter guesses (strings). A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use. This means you’ll need a way to grab a word to use for guessing. (This can be grabbed from a pre-made list. No need to get too fancy.) You will also need functions to check if the user has actually inputted a single letter, to check if the inputted letter is in the hidden word (and if it is, how many times it appears), to print letters, and a counter variable to limit guesses.

* Print function

* Variables

#### Code Example:
Here’s one with a timer from http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/game-hangman:

~~~ python
from builtins import input
import time

#welcoming the user
name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Hello, " + name + " Time to play hangman!")

print("")

#wait for 1 second
time.sleep(1)

print("Start guessing...")
time.sleep(0.5)

#here we set the secret
word = "secret"

#creates an variable with an empty value
guesses = ''

#determine the number of turns
turns = 10

# Create a while loop

#check if the turns are more than zero
while turns > 0:
    # make a counter that starts with zero
    failed = 0

    # for every character in secret_word
    for char in word:
        # see if the character is in the players guess
        if char in guesses:
            # print then out the character
            print(char)
        else:
            # if not found, print a dash
            print("_")
            # and increase the failed counter with one
            failed += 1

    # if failed is equal to zero
    # print You Won
    if failed == 0:
        print("You Win")
        # exit the loop, effectively ending the script
        break

    print("")

    # ask the user go guess a character
    guess = input("guess a character:")

    # set the players guess to guesses
    guesses += guess

    # if the guess is not found in the secret word
    if guess not in word:
        # turns counter decreases with 1 (now 9)
        turns -= 1

        # print wrong
        print("Wrong")

        # how many turns are left
        print("You have", + turns, 'more guesses')

        # if the turns are equal to zero
        if turns == 0:
            # print "You Lose"
            print("You Lose")

# Project 4: Nibbles

Difficulty Level: Intermediate

Language: Python 3 with Tkinter

## Concepts Learned:
* Importing modules
* Using Tkinter, the defacto GUI library for Python
* Basic multi-threading and concurrency
* Sprite generation
* Arrays and Dictionaries
* Object-oriented design

## Description
This project servers to intruduce you to the queue module in Python as used in conjunction with the threading module and basic introduction to concurrency and multi-threaded software. The game could have been implemented without threads and queues, but it would have been slower, longer, and a lot more complex. By using queues to manage data from multiple threads effectively, we have been able to contain the program to under 150 lines of code.

####
This project requires [Tkinter](http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/). This may have come with your python installation, if not, instructions for installing Tkinter can be found [here](http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/How_to_install_Tkinter).
